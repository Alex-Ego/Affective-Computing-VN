abstract = {The sharp rise in internet technology, and the influence of social media, along with the widespread use of affordable, intelligent devices, have significantly altered the way that users obtain information. The task here is to profit from massive amounts of data and the competence of the public to detect, when, and how the information is distributed, what people think or talk about it in social networks. Poor air quality is a grave concern for public health. Efficient and practical approaches are needed to detect harmful emissions. This paper evaluates the possible use of social networking sites by comparing Twitter data and justifying it with existing air monitoring stations to observe the air contamination of a metropolitan city. An Extended Temporary Memory (ETM) approach to air quality forecasting is proposed in this paper; besides, meteorological data are utilized with public perception, and Air Quality Forecast (AQF) response using social media is examined. Daily data on Air Quality (AQ), climatological conditions, and Weibo reception statistics have been collected in the city of Beijing, between January 2019 and December 2019. As a proxy for audience response, the mean emotion of the relevant posts has been used. Based on real figures, the performance of the proposed model has been assessed. Qualitative findings show that, out of 71.2% of air quality notifications, 80.7% of which were the first-hand study. Among the results, 31% reported aggressive behavior, while 20% shared a concern about safety. The findings have demonstrated that the suggested approach, which requires community feedback records, is ideally adapted for forecasting pollution levels in serious short-tenure communal incidents and offers rapid societal evaluation and ecological recommendations.}
