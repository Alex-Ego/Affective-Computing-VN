\paragraph{Objectives and Study Methods:}
In this thesis, open-sourced software is proposed, which interprets the text entered by a person and determines how they are feeling at the moment, with the purpose of being used in tandem with another software or algorithms focused on conversational data.

The study method used will make a comprehensive analysis of neural networks and supervised machine learning, as well as pattern recognition and data collection that will give us a moderately sufficient understanding of something as sometimes unpredictable as the human mind.
\newpage
\paragraph{Contributions and Conclusions:}
The training algorithm uses a specific dataset to predict, as accurately as possible, what a person is feeling when writing a sentence or phrase. The algorithm is open-source so anyone can add or remove modules as needed.

This thesis' conclusion is that it is possible for a Recurrent Neural Network algorithm to recognize patterns in a sentence using open-source tools, but it has to have a filtered, well-distributed dataset that includes words that are difficult to misclassify.
